P.S Currently, search optimization and responsive design have not been implemented yet. 

## Available Scripts

After cloning or downloading the project, run :  

### `cd react-search`  

Directs to the react-search directory

### `npm install`

Installs all the necessary dependencies to the local node_modules folder

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
